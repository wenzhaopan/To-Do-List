# Weather To Do This

Before you read the instructions, please note that this site is limited to 60 weather searches per minute. 
If you would like to use it more, please feel free to download the code and replace the const apiKey variable in the "script.js" file with your own API key. 
You can get your own API key by going to https://openweathermap.org/ and making your own account. You can then choose your own plan for how many API calls you would like to make!


Access the site here: https://wenzhaopan.github.io/Weather-To-Do-This/

Upon clicking the link, you will be taken to a page that looks like this

You can enter your tasks and select whether they will be indoors or outdoors from the dropdown menu
You can then click "add task" and the task will appear below in a list form.


Now, you can choose which city you will be doing these tasks in.
Simply enter the name of the city
ie: if I lived in Toronto, I would type "Toronto" into the search bar.

You will now be alerted with whether or not there is precipitation right now in a message similar to this one:

Depending on the weather, this will then change the tasks:

The tasks highlighted in red are not recommended to do because they clash with the weather.

Hope this helps with your task planning and productivity!
