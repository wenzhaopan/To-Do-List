Access the site here:

You will be taken to a page that looks like this

You can enter your tasks and select whether they will be indoors or outdoors from the dropdown menu
You can then click "add task" and the task will appear below in a list form.


Now, you can choose which city you will be doing these tasks in.
Simply enter the name of the city
ie: if I lived in Toronto, I would type "Toronto" into the search bar.

You will now be alerted with whether or not there is precipitation right now in a message similar to this one:

Depending on the weather, this will then change the tasks:

The tasks highlighted in red are not recommended to do because they clash with the weather.

Hope this helps with your task planning and productivity!
